# Patched-IPAs
A repo where (i hope) to post patched IPAs 

 - Why am i making this?
 - How are you making the IPAs
 - [Are your IPAs safe?](#Are-your-IPAs-safe?)
 
## Why am i making this?
Because i've recently switched from a rootfull jailbreak (checkra1n on 14.6) to a rootless jailbreak (palera1n on 15.7.8) and some tweaks that i was using aren't patched to work with rootless jailbreak. By injecting the tweak on the ipa and then installing the ipa via trollstore i will get the tweak working again.
## How are you making the IPAs?
Simply by using [sideloadly](https://sideloadly.io/)  
# Are your IPAs safe?
I don't know, are they? Jokes aside every IPA that i will post is tested by me and i will be sure to post the original source of the ipa and of the tweak
